This document describes the steps needed to create the conda environment on Expanse needed to execute mkde.
The updates described below to the mkde package will be pushed to CRAN once transtion from sp and raster
to terra has been completed.

--- Create conda environment and install packages ---

conda update -n base -c defaults conda
conda create -n r_seg r-base
conda activate r_seg
conda install -c anaconda boost
conda install udunits2
conda install gdal

launch R, then do following from prompt

install.packages('Rcpp')
install.packages('sf')
install.packages("codetools")

--- terra install ---

Install chokes when building RcppModule.o with
x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-c++, use the following to manually build this
object with g++, create new archive and install from command line.

wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/terra_1.7-71.tar.gz
gunzip -xzf terra_1.7-71.tar.gz
cd terra/src

cd
tar -cf terra_new_1.7-71.tar.gz terra
R CMD INSTALL terra_new_1.7-71.tar.gz

--- mkde install ---

In DESCRIPTION make following edit
Imports: Rcpp (>= 0.9.6), sp, raster --> Imports: Rcpp (>= 0.9.6), sf, terra

Then make new mkde package with automatically built NAMESPACE
R CMD build mkde
mv mkde_0.2.tar.gz mkde_new_0.2.tar.gz

R CMD INSTALL mkde_new_0.2.tar.gz

--- Additional notes ---

Get the following during terra install from command line after building RcppModule.o
